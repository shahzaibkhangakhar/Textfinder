Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning
        
        Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that aims to create 
        intelligent machines that work and react like humans. Machine Learning (ML) is a 
        subset of AI that enables computers to learn and improve from experience without 
        being explicitly programmed.
        
        Key areas of AI include:
        - Natural Language Processing
        - Computer Vision
        - Robotics
        - Expert Systems
        
        Machine Learning algorithms can be categorized into:
        - Supervised Learning
        - Unsupervised Learning
        - Reinforcement Learning
